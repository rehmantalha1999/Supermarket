The purpose of the website is to provide a web application which can be used by the marketers for their grocery products (generally perishable products like milk, eggs, fruits etc.). The marketers in a certain area can advertise their products and also show the expiry dates of the products so if the expiry is close-by they can give discounts etc. 

This web application can also be used by the customers who can shop for the products advertised by the marketers in the same region. 

A lot of good web development techniques were employed in this project such data sanitization, filteration, image name hashing, SQL injection prevention, HTML injection prevention, dynamic CSS and also email code confirmation for a new sign up.
